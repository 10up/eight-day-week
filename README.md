## Filters & Hooks ##
### Eight Day Week provides a number of filters and hooks for customizing and extending the plugin. ###

**Modules**
Eight Day Week follows a module-style approach to many of its features. These can be turned on or off via filters, and all work independently.
These are:
Article Byline
Article Count
Article Export
Article Status
Issue Publication
Issue Status
Any of these can be disabled by returning a falsey value from the following filter format:
`add_filter( 'Eight_Day_Week\Plugins\load_$plugin', '__return_false' );`
The `$plugin` value is a slug version of the plugin name, i.e. article-byline

**Article Table**
The information displayed in the list of articles within a Print Issue is filterable. Custom columns can be added via the following filters:
`Eight_Day_Week\Articles\article_columns` and `Eight_Day_Week\Articles\article_meta_$column_name`.
Sample usage:

	add_filter( 'Eight_Day_Week\Articles\article_columns', function( $columns ) {
	    $columns['byline'] = _x( 'Byline', 'Label for multiple, comma separated authors', 'your-text-domain' );
	    return $columns;
	} );
	add_filter( 'Eight_Day_Week\Articles\article_meta_byline', function( $incoming_value, $post ) {
	    return implode( ', ', wp_list_pluck( my_get_post_authors_function( $post ), 'display_name' ) );
	}


**Print Issue Table**
The information displayed in the list of Print Issues is filterable. Custom columns can be added via the following filter:
`Eight_Day_Week\Print_Issue_Columns\pi_columns`. Note that this is a convenience filter, the base filter is `manage_edit-print-issue_columns`
See `includes/functions/print-issue-columns.php` for sample usage.

**Article Export**
The export of posts in a Print Issue is highly customizeable, from the file name of the zip, to the file name of the individual files, to the contents of the files themselves.
The best reference would be to read through `includes/functions/plugins/article-export.php`.
[Here's](https://gist.github.com/joshlevinson/4a2c3ed78b21b3c54eba) a few examples used on the *Observer*.
